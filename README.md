# calculadora-react
This hands-on project was conceived with the goal of putting into practice all the concepts and skills acquired in the beginning of learning programming in React.  It is a simple calculator that could have easily been made in JS, but was made with React so that it was possible to explore the possibilities and understand how React programming works in practice.   It's a simple layout that performs basic math operations and returns the result, semi-responsive (the layout supports up to the dimension of a tablet, in smartphone resolution it starts to break, but it will be fixed).
